# Solar-Neighborhood
Plotting the positions of nearby stars using Mathematica.

**To Do** (Like I'll ever get around to this)
* Better rendering
* Sensible, automated scaling of each star's display radius based on largest star in the plot
* Figure out how to display nearby stars where one star is inside another's display radius
* Add distance labels (8ly, 16ly, etc) to the contours on the disk of the galactic plane
* Style tooltips and add more info
* What else?
